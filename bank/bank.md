**How to open a bank account**
<br>
To open a bank account you should have a "Residency Card" or TIE, where you will get your NIE (Spanish Identification Number). You will have to take in consideration that you might have a "temporary card", only valid for 3 months and not enought to open a bank account.  <a href=https://www.google.es/search?q=TIE&espv=2&biw=1008&bih=546&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMItrjLqKOSyAIVxOwUCh3WwQrg#tbm=isch&q=tarjeta+identidad+extranjero&imgrc=HUUkoNXOvBVRPM%3A">TIE</a>
<br>
It depends on the bank, but mandatory to present your TIE and maybe deposit your pay slip there.
<br> 
Once that you have this, the more difficult task will be choose which bank would you prefer.
