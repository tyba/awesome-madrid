**How to open a bank account**

To open a bank account you should have a "Residency Card" or TIE, where you will get your NIE (Spanish Identification Number). You will have to take in consideration that you might have a "temporary card", only valid for 3 months and not enought to open a bank account.  <a href=https://www.google.es/search?q=TIE&espv=2&biw=1008&bih=546&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMItrjLqKOSyAIVxOwUCh3WwQrg#tbm=isch&q=tarjeta+identidad+extranjero&imgrc=HUUkoNXOvBVRPM%3A">TIE</a>

It depends on the bank, but mandatory to present your TIE and maybe deposit your pay slip there.

Once that you have this, the more difficult task will be choose which bank would you prefer.
