**How do I look for an apartment**
<br>
This is maybe, one of the most difficult things that we have to face with. It is necessary to look in to the needs of the people, location, services around....
<br>
Important to know which areas Madrid has:
<br>
Here you will find <a href="http://barriosdemadrid.net/mapas/distritos/">Barrios de Madrid</a>,
there you will find the areas and get better idea of the situation.
<br>
The best are: retiro, centro and Salamance (the most expensive also) but, is not really hard to find something affordable in this areas.

*Where to look for an apartment*
There are two good web pages: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.idealista.com/en/alquiler-viviendas/madrid-madrid/mapa">Idealista</a>, this one in eglish
<br>
<a href="http://www.fotocasa.es/en/">Fotocasa</a> also in english
<br>
Both sites are really good for the search and with good filters.
