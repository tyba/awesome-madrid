##Important things to know about grocery shopping in Spain
  <br>
  <b>Bring your own plastic or reusable bags</b>
  <br>
  Grocery bags are not complimentary in Spain, as such make sure to bring your own, if not you will be charged (a couple of cents) per bag.
  <br><br>
  <b>Don't touch/taste the fruit or vegetables</b>
  <br>
  If the fruit and vegetables are self-service, plastic golves will be readily available. In spain you must be wearing a glove in order to touch and pick up your fresh fruit and vegetables. Some supermarkets will dispose of behind-the-counter workers that will help you choose and bag your items.
  <br><br>
  <b>Make sure to weigh your fruits and vetables</b>
  <br>
  Most fruit and vegetables available in supermarkets must be weighed before purchase. Keep in mind that the weighing of your items will have to be done previously to attending the counter. Each fruit will have a number next to it's price, which you will have to introduce in the weighing machine. A price label will be printed for you, which you will paste on top of your fruit/vegetable bag.
  <br><br>
  <b> Bring Change </b>
  <br>
  Some grocery stores have a minimum amount you must purchase in order to pay by credit/debit card (ie. at Dia it's 14 euros). Most people in Spain still pay by cash, and will count out the exact change, so be prepared.
  <br><br>
  <b>Not all items are refigerated</b>
  <br>
  Milk and eggs will not be refrigerated in Spain. Do not be alarmed, these products are prepared differently in Spain, so the boxes and cartons do not require refrigeration until after you have opened them. This allows you to purchase various bricks at a time, and stock up.
  <br><br>
  <b>Most grocery stores are closed on Sundays</b>
  <br>
  Most grocery stores in Spain remain closed on Sundays, except for a select few such as Carrefor (depending on Location), Vips, OpenCor and the Corte Ingles supermarket. Make sure to plan ahead and check the opening hours online before leaving the house. Last but not least, the Siesta is still very much part of the Spanish tradition, so don't be surprised if some supermarkets (ie. Condis), especially the local ones, are closed during the mid-day.
