**I have just landed in Spain...Now what?**
<br>

*European citizens*
<br>

<u/>NIE</u>
<br>
As an European, you don't need any permission to work in another European country: *artc. 3, section 2, EU Treaty (TUE)*, but in every country is mandatory that you register yourself at least.
<br>
Therefore, to legally work in Spain you will have to get a NIE (Spanish Identification Tax Number) and a Social Security Number.
<br>
To obtain your NIE, you will have to go to one Police Station (Calle San Felipe 7-9), **Tetuan** metro station (line 1)
<br>
Note that in this police station, they will give you a temporary one (not the permanent). Therefore, you will need to go in a maximum of three months to obtain the permanent one
<a href="www.seap.minhap.gob.es">make an appointment for permanent residency</a>
<br>
Wich ever you choose, you will have to:
- Fill out the form <a href="http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/OTTAWA/Documents/15-Formulario_NIE_y_certificados%5B1%5D.pdf">EX-15</a> (they will give you one copy there
- Photocopy of your ID (home country)
- Pay the fee, 10â‚¬
<br>
They will give you the document at the moment, so, you have 3 months to make another appointment (Padre Piquer 18, Madrid), so they will give you the permanent one (you can go 
directly there, but you usually have to wait one month to go there).

<br>
Social Security Number</u>
<br>
Once that you have you NIE, is really easy. You will have to go to the nearest one (Calle Santa Juliana 11) **Alvarado** metro station (line 1)
With your NIE and proof ID, they will give you at the moment your Social Security Number, mandatory to work in Spain.
